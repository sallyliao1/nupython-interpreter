# nupython-interpreter
This is a python interpreter written in C which supports loops, operator/expression logic, variable assignments, and select functions. The program dynamically allocates memory for the python programs using pointers.

This project was created in the Winter '24 section of Northwestern's CS 211: Fundamentals of Computer Programming II.
