# nupython-interpreter
This is a python interpreter written in C which supports loops, operator/expression logic, variable assignments, and select functions. The program dynamically allocates memory for the python programs using pointers.

This project was created in the Winter '24 section of a CS course. The base code was provided to all students, but many files were created by me: you can identify which files I made/modified significantly by looking at the headers. 

## How to use
Unfortunately, some .c files were given by the professor and were hidden from us: therefore, I can not upload them. However, you can still read through the .h files and my .c files to understand how it works.
